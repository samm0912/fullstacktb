You're on my frequency<br>
You've been staring at me<br>
Since you walked in the bar<br>
I don't really know how long though<br>
I don't need no fake love<br>
No, I don't need no favor<br>
I know my time go come<br>
Just me and my maker (da-da-da, da-da)<br>
I'm gonna make the paper (da-da-da, da-da)<br>

I cannot control my body<br>
So when this song is startin<br>
Just cancel all your plans o<br>
It's evident in my dancing<br>
Moonwalk like Michael Jackson<br>
To the left, to the right<br>
To the front with it go ye ye y<br>
To the left, to the right<br>
To the front with it go ye ye ye<br>
I already know just how it goes<br>
I already know just how it goes<br>
For the night, I'm riding solo<br>
Don't want no odo just leave me alone<br>
I been waiting, oh, all night long<br>
For the DJ to play my song<br>
I dey whine and grind on your booboo<br>
Somebody please don't call on the po-po<br>
Turn it up and then drop it low low<br>
All this lockdown it done make me kolo<br>
I been waiting, oh, all night long o<br>
Tonight I no go pick my phone<br>
'Cause I'm so gone, oh<br>
Get the fuck outta my way<br>

I cannot control my body<br>
So when this song is starting<br>
Just cancel all your plans o<br>
It's evident in my dancing<br>
Moonwalk like Michael Jackson<br>
I feel nice, there's nothing in my way<br>
Shawty wanna fuck, but I just want my space<br>
In a Lambo truck, I'm racing<br>
Rims still spinnin', I'm pacing<br>
I don't wanna talk, I'm dancing, dancing<br>
Straight to the bank<br>
Count Benji to Frank<br>
Walk out like I'm that bitch<br>
Put the braids back<br>
Movin' like Kelz<br>
Bad hoes in the back<br>
Singin', "That's that shit"<br>
Yeah, I really do talk like I walk<br>
Uh, I really been about that life<br>
Uh, shawty askin' me for advice<br>
And I told lil' baby, "All I got is the spice for ya"<br>
Get the fuck outta my way<br>
I'm gonna get paid, yeah<br>
I wanna get paid yeah<br>
Two time knockin'<br>
Ten man down<br>
You say you the king<br>
Where the crown at nigga?<br>
I've been muggin' since the first day<br>
And you couldn't see a nigga on my worst day, no<br>
Put Moliy on the record for the flex<br>
I was feeling kinda reckless<br>
Young lil' mama's a finesser, mmh<br>
